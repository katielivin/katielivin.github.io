    <h3 id="code2">Nolite te Bastardes Carborundorum</h3>
    <h2 id="title2">for free, from scratch (with no coding experience), for dummies (like me) </h2>
    <h3>In this post I am going to: 
        <ul>
            <li>Explain the benefits of creating your own website </li>
            <li>Vaguely summarize how I taught myself to use HTML and CSS </li>
            <li>Give an in depth tutorial on how to actually set up a website with GitHub (because I was so danged confused and the tutorials I read were Not! helpful. )</li>
        </ul>
</h3> 

    <h2 id=title2>Why making this website was worth it </h2>

    <h3>There’s a subtle art to making a website from scratch with no coding experience, and that art includes constantly pounding your head against the keyboard in frustration. Getting this website up was 90% smashing keys in anger. The finished result, at this point, is nowhere near finished and I would not recommend anyone copy my code, my organization of that code, or anything I’ve done for that matter, because it is bad! It is horrible! I am a beginner! However, I would encourage everyone to try making their own website, because it was actually worth it. Here’s why:
     </h3>

     <h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I made. A gosh danged. Website.</strong> 
        Granted, it’s pretty dinky, you can hardly call it scalable, and I was too lazy to learn Javascript before jumping in (what can you expect from an English major). But this is my website. It’s mine. And I made it and it looks how I want it to. That’s pretty cool. </li>
    </ul>
     </h3>
     <h3>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>No sweet, sweet cheddar involved.</strong> 
            The making of this website, while labor intensive, was 100% free. I did use a Udemy course to walk me through the basic steps of web development. But guess what? I bummed that course off of someone else who has a Udemy account. I’m a shameless leach. Other than that, the materials for creating the website were free and the hosting on GitHub was free. You can’t get better than free when you’re a broke college student. 
</li>
         </ul>
     </h3>

     <h3>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>It gave me confidence to learn more.</strong>
                I am but a lowly Humanities major who is trying to dip my toe into programing. When I started thinking about taking some Comp Sci courses so I could figure out how to make silly games, I was really intimidated. Attacking this website as my first project gave me a lot of confidence, because web development is pretty approachable. Of course, things get more complex when you start dealing with servers and large scale projects. But just making a dinky little personal site? Or even a one page site? I can do it, you can do it, anyone can do it, and that makes moving on to other projects less scary. 
</li>
         </ul>
     </h3>

    <h2 id="title2">How I learned how to make this website </h2>

    <h3>Here I have for your one word: leaching. There’s no need for you to go to a fancy coding bootcamp or purchase a two hundred dollar book when you can be an effective leach. Now I’m not going to advocate for stealing or pirating, since people should be payed for their labour etc etc. But this is the internet, so there’s no need to pirate when there’s tons of free information out there, right at your finger tips. When I was first dipping my toe into making websites I just typed  “how to make a website html css” into Google and found a ton of free information.</h3>

    <h3> Once I decided I wanted to stop goofing off and start working on a cohesive program, my boyfriend recommend the Udemy course “The Web Developer Bootcamp” by Colt Steele. I can attest that this course teaches you literally everything you need to know. It’s very in-depth and I was able to make a whole website after going about a third of the way through the course (you should probably go through the whole thing but, hey, I’m antsy). </h3>

    <h3>If you’ve got no one to leach off of, don’t fret. Like I said, this is the internet and you can find all of the information you need out there for free. The Udemy course didn’t teach me everything I used for my website. In fact, I got a lot of answers by just Googleing things. Most of the website was patched together thanks to the help of Google and Stack Overflow (god bless you Stack Overflow).</h3>

    <h3>One thing you will need to get started is a text editor. I’ve been using Sublime Text (which is, again, free) and I love it. </h3>

    <h2 id=title2>Here’s how to set up your text editor </h2>

        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Download sublime text </li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Open a new file in Sublime text, click “save as.”</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name the file file_name.html or file_name.css </li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hint: The file_name can be anything, like index.html or my_cat_is_named_harry.css
                </li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In an html file, type in “html”  and hit tab in order to set up the file, as shown in the gif below
                </li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>That is all + many weeks of fretting over how to get your website together</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id=title2>Now for The Goods. How to set up a personal website with Git Hub.</h2>

        <h3>(An easy, compressive guide on how I did it. So don’t come at me if this isn’t how you did it! This is how I did it! !!!) (Please note that I am doing this on the Github website, not on the desktop app! !!! This is important!) </h3>

        <h2 id=title2>Step 1: Set up a Git Hub account </h2>
        <h3>Okay, I’m not going to tell you how to do this. You have flesh in your skull. Use your mind meat. You can figure it out.</h3>


        <h2 id=title2>Step 2: Start a project. </h2>
        <h3>On your home page you will see this white button that says “Start a Project.” Click it. </h3>
        <img id=img1 src="img/Step1.png">

        <h2 id=title2>Step 3: Name your repository </h2>
        <h3>Name your repository (a repository is what you’re making here. Don’t ask me why it’s called that. I don’t know). Name it your_username.github.io, where your_username is your username. Ex: mine is katielivin.github.io . If you don’t name it this it will not work, capish? (Hint: mine is giving me an error message because I already have a repository with this name). After you’ve named it hit “Create repository.”</h3>
        <img id=img1 src="img/Step2.png">

        <h2 id=title2>Step 4: Upload your index.html file </h2>
        <h3>After you do all these steps you’ll get a very confusing page that gives you all of these options. Quick set up? Or create a new repository? Or push an existing repository? I have no idea what this stuff means. Here’s the easy way out. Click the blue link that says upload an existing file. Upload your index.html file (this should be the home page of your website. It has to be labeled index.html, or so I’ve been told.)</h3>
        <img id=img1 src="img/Step3.png">

        <h2 id=title2>Step 5: Upload the rest of your files  </h2>
        <h3>After you’ve uploaded your index page, find the button that says “upload files” and upload the rest of your files. After that, you should be able to go to your_username.github.io and see your website. </h3>
        <img id=img1 src="img/Step4.png">

        <h2 id=title2>Bonus: how to update your website </h2>
        <h3>If you make edits to your files but they retain their original name you can just upload the edited file and GitHub will detect the changes. </h3>

        <h3>
            Tada! You are done. I hope this was a useful tutorial (probably it was not because I don’t know what I’m doing. But that’s the fun of it.) If you liked it, please leave a comment below. Except that you can’t because I don’t know javascript because I’m lazy so there isn’t a comment section (yet). Toodaloo. Until next time. Etc. 
        </h3>
